# Python Class

This page is created as part of the python class held by Ju Ping and Diana for interns at Penang Science Cluster. The files `hello-world.py` and `guess-simple.py` are obtained directly from https://github.com/PenangScienceCluster/PythonCFA/tree/main/intro/scripts. From the same link, based on the file `guess_colours.py`, interns were challenged to rewrite the programme to allow the user to guess music _genres_ instead. Additionally, the programme may provide clue(s) in case of a failed guessing attempt. As an intern, here I have uploaded my code `guess-genres.py` that should do exactly that.

To run the programme, readers may open the file `guess-genre.py` here on github and paste it on any online python compiler such as [Programmiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/). For readers who have Git installed, they may download this repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/ezkiluzair/PSC-python-class` in Command Prompt and run the file `guess-genre.py` themselves.

For further details on how the programme should run, please refer to Wiki: [How it Runs](https://github.com/ezkiluzair/PSC-python-class/wiki#how-it-runs).
