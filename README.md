# Python Class

This page is created as part of the python class held by Ju Ping and Diana for interns at Penang Science Cluster. The files `hello-world.py` and `guess-simple.py` are obtained directly from https://github.com/PenangScienceCluster/PythonCFA/tree/main/intro/scripts. From the same link, based on the file `guess_colours.py`, interns were challenged to rewrite the programme that allows the user to guess music _genres_ instead. Additionally, the programme may provide clue(s) to in a failed guessing attempt. As an intern, here I have uploaded my code `guess-genres.py` that should do exactly that.
